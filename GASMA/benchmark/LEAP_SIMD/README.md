# LEAP-SIMD

This directory contains files only related the the SIMD-accelerated LEAP algorithm. All of the files contained here are adopted from https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/LEAP, authored by Hongyi Xin, et al.

We use C++ here instead of a mixture of C and C++ in the original directory so that we can compile a library for external usage, in particular, the benchmarking for the greedy algorithm.
